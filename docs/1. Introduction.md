# 1. Introduction
The NumTy library can compute number theoretic functions and sequences, solve a system of linear congruences, perform integer conversion between bases, generate prime numbers and more. The numty package comes with six modules: `base`, `congruences`, `multFunc`, `primes`, `quadResidues` and `sequences`. This documentation will show you how to use their capabilities.
