# 3. `congruences`
This module deals with divisibility and congruences.

## 3.1 Divisibility

`congruences.lcm(a, b)`
> Returns the least common multiple of a and b.

`congruences.gcd(a, b)`
> Returns the greatest common divisor of a and b.

`congruences.egcd(a, b)`
> Returns a tuple of two integers (x, y) such that gcd(a, b) = ax + by.


## 3.2 Congruences
`congruences.modInverse(a, m)`
> Returns an integer x such that ax = 1(mod m).

`congruences.reduceCongr(a, b, m)`
> Returns a tuple (1, c, n), where ax = b(mod m) is reduced to x = c(mod n).

`congruences.linCongr(a, b, m)`
> Returns the incongruent solutions to the linear congruence ax = b(mod m).

`congruences.crt(listOfCongruences)`
> Returns the incongruent solution a system of linear congruences whose moduli are relatively prime. The function expects each congruence to be in the form (a, b, m) where ax = b(mod m).

`congruences.linCongrSystem(listOfCongruences)`
> Returns the incongruent solution any system of linear congruences.

`congruences.polyCongr(coefficients, m)`
> Returns the incongruent solutions to the polynomial congruence specified by the given coefficients.
